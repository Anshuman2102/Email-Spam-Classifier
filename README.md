# Email-Spam-Classifier

Welcome to the Email Spam Classifier repository! This project aims to classify emails into spam or non-spam categories using machine learning techniques in Python.

## Installation

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the necessary libraries using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

numpy: A library for numerical computing.

pip install numpy
pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.

pip install pandas
These commands will install the required dependencies for the Email Spam Classifier project.

## Importing Dependencies

Before running the classifier, ensure to import the necessary dependencies in your Python script:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
Getting Started

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start using the Email Spam Classifier. You may explore the provided Python script to understand how the classifier works and how you can utilize it for your own email datasets.
